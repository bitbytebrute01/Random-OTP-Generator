So basically, I’m not using any fancy libraries here—just plain JavaScript. I used Math.random() to get random numbers and generate a 6-digit OTP. Then, I used getElementById() to grab the part of the HTML where the OTP shows up (which initially just has ------). When the button is clicked, the script replaces those dashes with the new OTP. It’s all done using simple DOM manipulation, so the page updates right away without refreshing. Just a clean and basic example of how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript.
